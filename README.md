# Momo: Love Your Time

Momo is a personal wellbeing companion that helps people stay mindful of their screen habits.  
It encourages focus and balance by providing gentle feedback when selected apps are used for longer than intended.

## Purpose
Momo promotes digital wellbeing, not restriction.  
The app helps users notice when their attention is being pulled away and gently encourages them to return to more intentional use of their devices.

## How It Works
- Users choose the apps they want Momo to monitor.
- Momo uses Apple's Family Controls and DeviceActivity frameworks to detect time spent in those apps.
- When usage exceeds a personal threshold, the app updates the user's focus state.
- No data is collected, stored, or shared externally. Everything runs privately on device.

## Privacy
Momo follows Apple's guidelines for digital wellbeing and uses only approved system APIs.  
No personal information, app names, or usage logs leave the user's device.
