# Momo: Love Your Time

**Momo** is a mindful focus companion that helps people maintain healthier relationships with their screens.  
It monitors time spent in selected apps and sends simple signals to a Bluetooth-connected device that reacts visually — helping users recognize when it’s time to take a break.

## Purpose
To make people more aware of how they use their time through gentle feedback, not control.

## How it works
1. The user selects which apps they want Momo to monitor.
2. When time spent exceeds a threshold, Momo sends a small signal to a connected BLE device.
3. The device reacts (e.g., changing color) to indicate focus, distraction, or recovery.
4. No data is stored or shared — everything stays on device.

## Built with
- **SwiftUI** (iOS app)
- **Arduino BLE Nano 33** (hardware companion)
- **Apple Family Controls API**
- **DeviceActivity framework**
